## This repo have a son! :)
This repo was a 'patch' for one of my hardest challenge. Update the local repo with the latest commit.

I did it at 3:00am as fast as possible, because is very annoying connect to the server (via ssh) and run a `git pull` for every commit. :/\
I'll rewrite this code on [ForumPlayer/git-websocket-updater](https://github.com/ForumPlayer/git-websocket-updater).

I'm trying to use a 'relay' to repass the message (`"Hey, we have updates! git pull!"`) to more than one servers.

So, bye.
